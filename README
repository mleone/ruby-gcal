RUBY-GCAL

A Ruby library for the Google Calendar API.  ruby-gcal makes use of GData's 
batch processing features, allowing you to add/update/delete multiple events
with a single HTTP request.

RUNNING THE TESTS:
For now, in order to make the tests pass, you must add valid auth tokens
as test data.

1.  Copy test/calendar_tokens.yml.example to test/calendar_tokens.yml
2.  Edit the file to contain strings of valid authsub tokens:
      :normal_account_token should be from a Google account with Google Calendar
        set up.
      :no_setup_account_token should be from a Google account which has never 
        been logged into the Google Calendar app.
